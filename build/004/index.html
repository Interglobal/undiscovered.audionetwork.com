                <div class="artist-description">
                  <p>Hailing from a small market town in rural North Yorkshire, Henry and Nathan’s first musical experiences came from raiding their older brothers’ extensive cassette tape collections.</p>
                  <p>On those tapes they found an eclectic range of music that would go on to shape their own sound. “Both of our older brothers were really into dance music, so we were getting loads of cassettes of pirate radio recordings, acid house and loads of electronica. We'd just sit and listen to all of these cassettes and then try and get that into a band.”</p>
                  <p>Not content with just playing in a band, they decided to set up their own studio and collective, Dental Records. “We'd played together in a band for ages, and when you're writing tunes and want to write more it becomes increasingly difficult to do that in a rehearsal room. So we decided we needed a better space to do it in. Dental Records is really just like a collective of our friends – we've got people that do video, guys that do graphic design and people who do music as well.”
</p>
                  <p>Despite their many different projects, those early cassette tapes are still a key component of their music today. “I think you can still kind of hear where we started out; you can still hear those early influences now. I don’t think I realised it at the time, but they were massively important, because they got us obsessed by music.”</p>

                <div class="artist-description">
                  <p>A classically trained composer who’s also played in a post-rock band, James Dexterous creates truly original cinematic scores using samples and percussion that at times border on the bizarre.</p>
                  <p>This originality is born out of his unusual approach to writing. “I've always found creativity thrives when you're limited and often accidents in the music become the leading motif. So, more often than not with these tracks, the composition began by recording things that couldn't possibly be considered musical.”</p>
                  <p>His desire for original sounds knows no bounds, and often he finds them in the most unusual places. “I'm talking about violently swiping my shower curtain across its rail, opening and closing sock drawers, hitting boxes with cheap microphones and dripping water into a colander. I'd listen carefully to 30 minutes of nonsense and pick out sounds I thought had character.”</p>
                  <p>Along with his classical background, James also cites his time playing in a band as a big influence on his compositions. “Playing guitar in a band taught me to be more tasteful when composing parts and allowing certain parts to sit back and let something else shine. I was mad about looping and reversing in the band, which was the beginning of my interest in sound design and has absolutely remained a part of my style.”</p>

              <div class="artist-description">
                <p>Born and raised in Bangor, Northern Ireland, Paddy’s passion for music started at a young age. “I always had a keyboard sitting around the house that I would play, and I taught myself guitar and bass. My mother was always playing the Beatles. So I've always had that influence – which is good for the soul.”</p>
                <p>As soon as he could play, Paddy quickly moved on to recording and started putting his music to tape aged just 11. “From a young age I was really into recording, whether it was just on a tape recorder or MiniDisc. I'm really glad I was part of that phase as I think it was really cool – I’d love to record to tape again.”</p>
                <p>It was when he went to university that he discovered the ‘Glasgow sound’ that would go on to define his style. “I played music with a guy at university in Newcastle, and then we moved up to Glasgow to pursue our music there as we loved the scene so much - Belle & Sebastian, Mogwai and Camera Obscura.”</p>
                <p>Since leaving university, Paddy has toured the UK and Ireland with his band Kowalski, supporting the likes of Two Door Cinema Club, Alt-J and his favourite band Snow Patrol. “One main musical influence for me, because of where I come from, is Snow Patrol's first album, Songs For Polarbears. They're from my hometown of Bangor, and we used to play covers of the album – that really got me wanting to play in an indie rock band.”</p>

                <div class="artist-description">
                  <p>Daniel Harwood, aka Dialate, began producing music at the age of 14. Not content with pigeonholing himself with one style, he’s experimented with many different genres of electronic music.</p>
                  <p>Like most producers, his passion for electronic music was born from a desire to create something truly original. “I like the idea of making sounds that haven’t existed before. If you listen to a rock band their sounds can be altered, but with electronic music you can create a noise that has never been made before, even now. It’s not something slightly different, like using an alternate chord – it’s something completely new and exciting.”</p>
                  <p>However, his first attempts at making music didn’t quite work out. “I was interested in producing because I had no idea of how electronic music was made so I downloaded a demo version of Fruity Loops. I got so frustrated with it that I deleted it, but then a couple of years later I went back to it. I was getting agitated that I wasn’t making professional music so I gave it another go and now, here I am.”</p>
                  <p>These days he is an accomplished producer, experimenting with many different styles. “I’m experimenting more and more with recording techniques in the studio, but I’m not too bothered how I create music as long as I can recreate what I hear in my head.”</p>
